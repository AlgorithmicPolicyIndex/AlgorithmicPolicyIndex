# API
I am Jeremy, or Kaylee online, or as per my brand AlgorithmicPolicyIndex or API for short. Too many names I know  
I came up with API, because I wanted to make something uinque to me, a name that is based on hobbies, API was a funny coincidence because I did not plan for it to shorten to API.
